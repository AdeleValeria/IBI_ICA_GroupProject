GC content is the percentage of either guanine or cytosine nucleotides in part of a DNA or the whole genome. Between Guanine and Cytosine, there are three hydrogen bonds while Adenine-Thymine base pairs have only two. This means that Guanine-Cytosine base pairs contribute more to DNA stability than Adenine-Thymine base pairs. Therefore, the stability and melting temperature of DNA depend on the GC content. In polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments, GC content can also be used to predict annealing temperature of primers to the template DNA. 
In task 1, we computed the GC content for a DNA sequence given by user. We used a for loop to compute each base from the beginning of DNA sequence and counted the number of Guanine and Cytosine. The GC content was output in percentage.
