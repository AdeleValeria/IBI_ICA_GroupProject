Task 1

Explain the problem and biological importance:
GC content is the percentage of Guanine and Cytosine nucleotides in part of a DNA. Between Guanine and Cytosine, there are three hydrogen bonds while Adenine-Thymine base pairs have only two. This means that Guanine-Cytosine base pairs contribute more to DNA stability than Adenine-Thymine base pairs. Therefore, the stability and melting temperature of DNA depend on the GC content. In polymerase chain reaction (PCR) experiments, GC content can also be used to predict annealing temperature of primers to the template DNA. 

The approach you took:
1¡¢We used a for loop to count the number of Guanine and Cytosine. 
2¡¢The number of Guanine and Cytosine was divided by the length of the DNA sequence to calculate the percentage.
  
The result:
The percentage of the GC content.
