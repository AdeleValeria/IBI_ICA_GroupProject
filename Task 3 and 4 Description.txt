Task 3

Explain the problem and biological importance:
The genetic information stored in DNA cannot be directly converted into proteins as the cellular protein factory ¨C ribosomes only read instruction in the form of RNA. Therefore, a Central Dogma process known as transcription is important for converting the sequences of bases in DNA into RNA messages. 

The approach you took:
    1. Request user input of DNA sequence.
    2. Complimentary base-pairing. Replace A to U, C to G, G to C and T to A.
    3. For each deoxynucleotide in DNA, add its complimentary base to a string variable. 

The result:
Show the mRNA sequence inside the string variable to the screen. 


Task 4

Explain the problem and biological importance:
Translation, the second step of the Central Dogma converts sequences of bases in mRNA into chains of amino acids or proteins.

The approach you took
    1. Request user input of mRNA sequence.
    2. Continue the process if the input only contains the letters: A, U, G and C.
    3. Return the index position of the first occurrence of AUG.
    4. To loop through the mRNA sequence and access 3 elements at the same time, use for in range with step size of 3. The 3 elements will form a codon.
    5. Retrieve the amino acid 1-letter code of the codon from a dictionary.
    6. For each codon in mRNA, add its 1-letter code to a string variable.

The result:
Show the amino acids sequence in the string variable to the screen.
